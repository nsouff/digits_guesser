# Hand written digit guesser
This is an artificial intelligence personal project using the mnist dataset of handwritten digits to train a neural network. The user can then draw a number and the model will (try) to guess it.
## Requirements
You can find the requirements [here](requirements.txt) or install it with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
## Usage
To draw a number type `python3 draw.py` and start drawing a number, to see what the model predict press the space bar.\
If you want to remove the used model and train a new model type `python3 train.py`.\
Finally if you want to evaluate the accuracy of the model see examples of predictions type `python3 evaluate.py`.
